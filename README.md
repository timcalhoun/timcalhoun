I'm currently working full time, while pursuing a Certificate in Data Science from Bethel School of Technology. I love looking at what visualizations data can make after being wrangled and correlated.  I'm learning more about SQL currently on the side from DataCamp and that has been a lot of fun.

For my DS projects, I'm currently learning about GitHub and the workings of how to present my knowledge.  What I love about Data Science, is I'm always learning something new every second, every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month, and every year. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R, Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Tableau.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building projects to further my knowledge.
- ðŸ˜€ In my free time I like to golf, hang with my wife & 2 kids, drink breve lattes, and eat tacos.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've "lived" in 6 states.
